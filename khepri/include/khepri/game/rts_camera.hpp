 * that translates the camera across the XY plane, rotate it around the camera's target and zooms it
 * in or out (all while ensuring the camera doesn't clip through objects or terrain, if any).

 * (e.g. pitch, FoV, distance-to-target) via the controller's zoom level so that zooming in or out
 * changes these properties.
